In this game, players control a small robot tasked with changing lightbulbs. The game is started with the prompt "reverse planned obsolescence," where an object that would normally have a limited lifespan is made more durable.

The game begins with a Ted talk introducing the robot and a short animation showing a family receiving their new robot. The tutorial then follows the player's character as it is replaced by a newer model and sent to a landfill. However, the player's character escapes by rebuilding itself using old robot parts and has the option to choose from four different paths:

Engage in a boss fight with the new model, "Bulb Man 3000".
Take revenge on the CEO of Pheobus Bulb company by destroying their factory.
Search for a secret, everlasting lightbulb and bring it to the attention of the media.
Assemble an army of other discarded robots and take over the world.
Throughout the game, players must navigate and complete tasks as they progress through the story.
